      </h1>
      <p>
        Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds
        of berries from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus. From the
        coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw
        product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process
        which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which
        is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water
        before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.
      </p>

      <p>
        Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a
        stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.
        It is one of the most popular drinks in the world and can be prepared
        and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press,
        caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served
        hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar
        substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste
        or enhance the flavor. It may be served with coffee cake or another
        sweet dessert, like doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells
        prepared coffee beverages is known as a coffeehouse or coffee shop
        (not to be confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling cannabis). Clinical
        research indicates that moderate coffee consumption is benign or
        mildly beneficial as a stimulant in healthy adults, with continuing
        research on whether long-term consumption has positive or negative
        effects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied
        closely to food traditions around the Red Sea. The earliest credible
        evidence of the drinking of coffee in the form of the modern beverage
        appears in modern-day Yemen from the mid-15th century in Sufi shrines,
        where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar
        to current methods. The Yemenis procured the coffee beans from the
        Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries and began
        cultivation. By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of
        the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe. In the
        20th century, coffee became a much more global commodity, creating
        different coffee cultures around the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are C. arabica and C.
        robusta. Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily
        in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Indian
        subcontinent, and Africa. As of 2018, Brazil was the leading grower of
        coffee beans, producing 35% of the world total. Coffee is a major
        export commodity as the leading legal agricultural export for numerous
        countries. It is one of the most valuable commodities exported by
        developing countries. Green, unroasted coffee is the most traded
        agricultural commodity and one of the most traded commodities overall,
        second only to petroleum. Despite the sales of coffee reaching
        billions of dollars, those actually producing the beans are
        disproportionately living in poverty. Critics also point to the coffee
        industry's negative impact on the environment and the clearing of land
        for coffee-growing and water use. The environmental costs and wage
        disparity of farmers are causing the market for fair trade and organic
        coffee to expand. Coffee farmers do not get profits from the market
        value as compared to the coffee processing companies.

      <h1>Different Types Of Coffee, Roasts, And Drinks</h1>
      <p>Different types of coffee can refer to various things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The type of coffee plant</li>
        <li>The level of roast</li>
        <li>The brewing method used</li>
        <li>The type of drinks prepared with the coffee</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Coffee drinks can be classified into two broad categories: hot and
        cold. The differences between drink types will depend on the type of
        base coffee, whether you added milk, the ratio of coffee to milk, and
        other ingredients.
      </p>
      <h1>What Are The Types Of Coffee Beans?</h1>
      <p>
        Coffee beans can be classed into four types: Arabica, Robusta,
        Liberica, and Excelsa. These are the four main species of the coffee
        plant, and all types of coffee will generally be a variety of one of
        these plants. The most common types of coffee beans are Arabica and
        Robusta, which combined account for 90% of global coffee production.
      </p>

            height: 400px;

            border-radius: 15px;
          " src="images/beans.jpg" alt="" />
      <h2>1. Arabica</h2>
      <p>
        Arabica coffee is the most commonly grown type of coffee, making up
        around 60% of commercially grown coffee. Arabica plants have the best
        quality when grown at high altitudes in volcanic soils, with plenty of
        rainfall. The downside to Arabica plants is that they are more
        susceptible to disease. Arabica beans have an oval shape and are
        larger than Robusta beans.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are dozens of varieties of Arabica coffee, including Bourbon,
        Caturra, Pacamara, and Typica. The extract taste of each Arabica
        coffee will depend on the variety, but it is generally sweeter and
        more complex than Robusta coffee. Good quality Arabica coffee has a
        medium body, bright acidity, and multiple layers of flavor and aroma.
        Most specialty coffees will be of the Arabica type.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here’s a more detailed article on what Arabica coffee is:
        https://www.homegrounds.co/what-is-arabica-coffee/.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Robusta</h2>
      <p>
        Robusta coffee is the second most common type of coffee, accounting
        for around 40% of coffee production. Robusta plants get their name
        because they are hardier than Arabica plants, and they are less prone
        to disease and grow well in wider environments, including low
        altitudes. Robusta beans are smaller, and rounder and have a higher
        concentration of caffeine than Arabica beans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Robusta coffee has many unidentified heirloom varieties, but you can
        categorize them into Erecta (upright varieties) or Nganda (spreading
        varieties). The taste of Robusta coffee beans is dark and earthy and
        can have bitter or burnt flavors. Although the flavor is considered
        inferior to Arabica, it can add complexity when used in
        Arabica-Robusta blends.
      </p>
      <h2>3. Liberica</h2>
      <p>
        Liberica coffee is relatively rare among commercial crops, accounting
        for less than 2% of the coffee produced worldwide. Liberica coffee
        grows taller than Arabica or Robusta, with trees reaching 20 meters
        high. Liberica beans are longer than other coffee types and have a
        unique hook shape at one end. Libera coffee is lower in caffeine than
        either Arabica or Robusta.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to the rarity of Liberica coffee, its varieties are not well
        known. The taste of Liberica coffee is sweeter than Arabica, with
        strong fruit and floral flavors, and it also has a smokiness and
        full-body reminiscent of Robusta coffee.
      </p>
      <h2>4. Excelsa</h2>
      <p>
        Excelsa was once considered a different type of coffee but has now
        been reclassified as a subtype of Liberica. Like other Liberica
        coffees, Excelsa grows on tall trees rather than shrubs. Excelsa beans
        have a unique teardrop shape but are smaller than Liberica beans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Excelsa is a variety of Liberica and does not have any varieties
        itself. Excelsa coffee can develop sweet, fruity flavors with tart
        acidity when grown correctly.
