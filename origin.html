      <h1>The origin of coffee</h1>
      <p>
        Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the
        ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau. There, legend says
        the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these beloved
        beans.
      </p>
      <img src="images/zeynep-sumer-XgxnIhfcS_M-unsplash.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="..." />
      <p>
        The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he noticed that
        after eating the berries from a certain tree, his goats became so
        energetic that they did not want to sleep at night. Kaldi reported his
        findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a drink with
        the berries and found that it kept him alert through the long hours of
        evening prayer. The abbot shared his discovery with the other monks at
        the monastery, and knowledge of the energizing berries began to
        spread. As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian peninsula,
        it began a journey which would bring these beans across the globe.
      </p>
      <h1>The Arabian Peninsula</h1>
      <p>
        Coffee cultivation and trade began on the Arabian Peninsula. By the
        15th century, coffee was being grown in the Yemeni district of Arabia
        and by the 16th century it was known in Persia, Egypt, Syria, and
        Turkey. Coffee was not only enjoyed in homes, but also in the many
        public coffee houses — called qahveh khaneh — which began to appear in
        cities across the Near East. The popularity of the coffee houses was
        unequaled and people frequented them for all kinds of social activity.
        Not only did the patrons drink coffee and engage in conversation, but
        they also listened to music, watched performers, played chess and kept
        current on the news. Coffee houses quickly became such an important
        center for the exchange of information that they were often referred
        to as “Schools of the Wise.” With thousands of pilgrims visiting the
        holy city of Mecca each year from all over the world, knowledge of
        this “wine of Araby” began to spread.
      </p>
      <h1>Coffee Comes to Europe</h1>
      <p>
        European travelers to the Near East brought back stories of an unusual
        dark black beverage. By the 17th century, coffee had made its way to
        Europe and was becoming popular across the continent. Some people
        reacted to this new beverage with suspicion or fear, calling it the
        “bitter invention of Satan.” The local clergy condemned coffee when it
        came to Venice in 1615. The controversy was so great that Pope Clement
        VIII was asked to intervene. He decided to taste the beverage for
        himself before making a decision, and found the drink so satisfying
        that he gave it papal approval. Despite such controversy, coffee
        houses were quickly becoming centers of social activity and
        communication in the major cities of England, Austria, France, Germany
        and Holland. In England “penny universities” sprang up, so called
        because for the price of a penny one could purchase a cup of coffee
        and engage in stimulating conversation. Coffee began to replace the
        common breakfast drink beverages of the time — beer and wine. Those
        who drank coffee instead of alcohol began the day alert and energized,
        and not surprisingly, the quality of their work was greatly improved.
        (We like to think of this a precursor to the modern office coffee
        service.) By the mid-17th century, there were over 300 coffee houses
        in London, many of which attracted like-minded patrons, including
        merchants, shippers, brokers and artists. Many businesses grew out of
        these specialized coffee houses. Lloyd's of London, for example, came
        into existence at the Edward Lloyd's Coffee House.
      </p>
      <h1>The New World</h1>
      <p>
        In the mid-1600's, coffee was brought to New Amsterdam, later called
        New York by the British. Though coffee houses rapidly began to appear,
        tea continued to be the favored drink in the New World until 1773,
        when the colonists revolted against a heavy tax on tea imposed by King
        George III. The revolt, known as the Boston Tea Party, would forever
        change the American drinking preference to coffee.
      </p>
      <h1>Plantations Around the World</h1>
      <p>
        As demand for the beverage continued to spread, there was fierce
        competition to cultivate coffee outside of Arabia. The Dutch finally
        got seedlings in the latter half of the 17th century. Their first
        attempts to plant them in India failed, but they were successful with
        their efforts in Batavia, on the island of Java in what is now
        Indonesia. The plants thrived and soon the Dutch had a productive and
        growing trade in coffee. They then expanded the cultivation of coffee
        trees to the islands of Sumatra and Celebes.
      </p>
      <h1>Coming to the Americas</h1>
      <p>
        In 1714, the Mayor of Amsterdam presented a gift of a young coffee
        plant to King Louis XIV of France. The King ordered it to be planted
        in the Royal Botanical Garden in Paris. In 1723, a young naval
        officer, Gabriel de Clieu obtained a seedling from the King's plant.
        Despite a challenging voyage — complete with horrendous weather, a
        saboteur who tried to destroy the seedling, and a pirate attack — he
        managed to transport it safely to Martinique. Once planted, the
        seedling not only thrived, but it’s credited with the spread of over
        18 million coffee trees on the island of Martinique in the next 50
        years. Even more incredible is that this seedling was the parent of
        all coffee trees throughout the Caribbean, South and Central America.
        The famed Brazilian coffee owes its existence to Francisco de Mello
        Palheta, who was sent by the emperor to French Guiana to get coffee
        seedlings. The French were not willing to share, but the French
        Governor's wife, captivated by his good looks, gave him a large
        bouquet of flowers before he left— buried inside were enough coffee
        seeds to begin what is today a billion-dollar industry. Missionaries
        and travelers, traders and colonists continued to carry coffee seeds
        to new lands, and coffee trees were planted worldwide. Plantations
        were established in magnificent tropical forests and on rugged
        mountain highlands. Some crops flourished, while others were
        short-lived. New nations were established on coffee economies.
        Fortunes were made and lost. By the end of the 18th century, coffee
        had become one of the world's most profitable export crops. After
        crude oil, coffee is the most sought commodity in the world.
