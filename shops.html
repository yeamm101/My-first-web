      <h1>10 Most Famous Coffee Chains in the World (2022 Update)</h1>
      <p>
        Coffee is ubiquitous in modern society. In every culture, in every
        part of the world, people drink coffee. The industrious minds of the
        past recognized this widespread appeal, and the more entrepreneurial
        of them seized the opportunity to make coffee a commodity that they
        could profit from. Today, we see the fruits of their labor in the
        numerous coffee chains that have taken root worldwide. You might be
        wondering what the most famous coffee chain is and, if you are, you’re
        in luck. This article discusses the 10 most famous coffee chains and
        gives you a brief overview of their scope and what makes them so
        popular.

      <h2>1. Starbucks</h2>

        <p>
          If you’re surprised, raise your hand. No one? Well, that doesn’t
          shock us since you can hardly walk a block in any major city in the
          world without running into a Starbucks. By almost any metric you can
          think of, Starbucks is at the top of the list of successful coffee
          companies, and they have nearly 30,000 locations around the globe.
          Starbucks was originally founded in Seattle 50 years ago in 1971 but
          has since found its way to every corner of the globe.

      <h2>2.Costa Coffee</h2>

        <img style="width: 300px; height: auto; border-radius: 15px" src="images/jeet-dhanoa-I-9MaQur4XA-unsplash.jpg"
          class="col-md-6 float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3" alt="..." />

        <p>
          Costa Coffee is sort of like the European Starbucks, except
          Starbucks also exists in Europe. In a striking coincidence, Costa
          Coffee was founded in 1971 – the same year as Starbucks – in the
          United Kingdom. They have approximately 3,500 locations, mostly in
          European countries, and are still very popular in Europe despite
          Starbucks’ meteoric rise.

      <h2>3. Dunkin’ Donuts</h2>
      <div class="clearfix">

          src="images/salman-sidheek-iqUBrnM-Zxc-unsplash.jpg" class="col-md-6 float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3" alt="..." />

        <p>
          Dunkin’ Donuts is probably more well-known for coffee than it is for
          its doughnuts, and that’s saying something considering it is
          literally named after doughnuts. Recently, the company has started a
          rebrand to simply “Dunkin’” to reflect the increasing popularity of
          its coffee and other offerings besides doughnuts. They have around
          11,000 locations, making them one of the largest coffee companies,
          even though they also offer breakfast sandwiches, bagels, and yes,
          doughnuts.

      <h2>4. Tim Hortons</h2>

        <img style="width: 300px; height: auto; border-radius: 15px" src="images/erik-mclean-QYkxVBwNmoQ-unsplash.jpg"
          class="col-md-6 float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3" alt="..." />

        <p>
          Tim Hortons is a Canadian coffee company boasting 5,000 locations in
          the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and China. If you’re
          from the United States, you probably think of Tim Hortons as
          Canadian Dunkin’ Donuts, and that’s not a bad comparison. They serve
          sandwiches and doughnuts in addition to the coffee responsible for
          their rise to prominence.

      <h2>5. McCafé</h2>
      <div class="clearfix">
        <img style="width: 300px; height: auto; border-radius: 15px" src="images/erik-mclean-peh3PFc5Wdo-unsplash.jpg"
          class="col-md-6 float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3" alt="..." />

        <p>
          McDonald’s isn’t typically known for coffee, but the burger giant is
          one of the largest coffee companies in the world as well. The McCafé
          brand started in 1993 as an add-on to the fast-food restaurant
          change, so it is a relative newcomer to the coffee scene compared to
          the other companies on this list. This only makes their 10,000
          stores worldwide even more impressive. Not every McDonald’s offers
          the McCafé brand, but more are added every day. Given the rate of
          growth over the last three decades, we wouldn’t be surprised if they
          eventually become the largest coffee company in the world.

      <h2>6. Lavazza</h2>

          class="col-md-6 float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3" alt="..." />

        <p>
          Lavazza is the oldest company on this list and also the first that
          isn’t associated with a vast empire of brick and mortar stores.
          Founded in Italy in 1895, Lavazza is wildly popular and one of the
          most famous coffee brands anywhere in the world. Lavazza’s
          popularity comes from its impressive selection of high-quality
          coffee beans and coffee-brewing gear.

      <h2>7. Peet’s Coffee</h2>

          src="images/colin-fitzgerald-OFqwWiWNb9Y-unsplash.jpg" class="col-md-6 float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3" alt="..." />

        <p>
          Peet’s Coffee doesn’t have an impressive array of stores – only 200
          locations – but their coffee is sold in 14,000 stores around the
          world, making them one of the biggest coffee brands. Unlike the
          other companies discussed so far, Peet’s is basically entirely
          focused on the United States, where all but one of their stores are
          located. Still, the sheer number of stores that carry them makes
          them one of the largest coffee producers despite their relatively
          narrow geographical scope.

          class="col-md-6 float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3" alt="..." />

        <p>
          Gloria Jean’s is an Australian coffee company with 1,000 stores in
          almost 40 global markets. Despite their global presence, they are
          lesser-known than some other brands, mostly because almost half of
          their locations are in Australia. Still, strictly by the numbers,
          Gloria Jean’s is one of the world’s most famous coffee chains.

          class="col-md-6 float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3" alt="..." />

        <p>
          Tully’s is an interesting case. At one point, Tully’s would have
          been near the top of this list, but recent supply-chain issues have
          reduced Tully’s to a shadow of its former self. In the last 2-3
          years, Tully’s has closed a large fraction of its locations
          resulting in a dramatically reduced presence around the world.
          Still, they have more than 300 open locations and are one of the
          most famous and recognizable brands, mostly due to their past
          prominence.

        <p>
          Rounding out the top ten, we have Caribou Coffee. Founded in 1992 –
          one year before McCafé – in Minnesota, Caribou has slowly grown to
          be one of the largest and most recognizable coffee companies in the
          world. Caribou Coffee has around 600 locations across the world, and
          like Dunkin’ Donuts, Tim Hortons, and Starbucks, they also serve
          snacks, baked goods, and other beverages.
